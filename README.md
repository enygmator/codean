# Codean

## Introduction

**Codean** (CODE Area Network) is something of a VPN for individuals in  software development teams to collaborate with each other while coding together.

It has in-built services like chat, audio and video interaction combined with a great code editor with support for importing and working with Git repositories and integrating your Codean dev env (Codean development environment) into GitHub (for features like PRs).

Note that all features of this platform aren't yet available as the project is still in development.

## Installing & Using Codean

## How does it work?

Codean uses Blazor (ASP.NET core v5) to power all client experiences within the browser.

More details coming soon...
